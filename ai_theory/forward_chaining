Forward chaining is a method of inference in first-order logic that starts with the available knowledge and uses inference rules to derive new knowledge. In forward chaining, we start with a set of known facts, also called axioms or assertions, and apply inference rules to derive new facts until we reach our goal.

Forward chaining is also known as data-driven reasoning or bottom-up reasoning, because it starts with the data and uses that data to drive the reasoning process. Forward chaining can be useful in situations where we have a large amount of data and we want to extract useful information from it.

The process of forward chaining can be broken down into the following steps:

Start with the known facts: We begin by identifying the set of known facts or axioms that we have. These facts can be represented using first-order logic statements, such as predicates or propositions.

Apply inference rules: Next, we apply inference rules to the known facts to derive new facts. Inference rules are logical rules that allow us to make new conclusions based on the known facts. For example, we might use the modus ponens rule, which says that if we know that A implies B and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true.

Add new facts: Once we derive a new fact, we add it to our set of known facts and repeat the process of applying inference rules to derive new facts. This process continues until we have derived all the facts that we are interested in.

Let's look at an example to illustrate how forward chaining works:

Suppose we have the following knowledge base:

If it's raining, then the ground is wet.
It's raining.
Our goal is to determine whether the ground is wet. To achieve this goal, we can use forward chaining to derive new facts. Starting with the known fact that it's raining, we can apply the first inference rule to conclude that the ground is wet. This gives us a new fact:

The ground is wet.
Now we have achieved our goal and we can stop applying inference rules.

Note that forward chaining can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large knowledge bases, because it requires repeatedly applying inference rules to the set of known facts. However, forward chaining can be a powerful tool for knowledge discovery and can be used in a variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, expert systems, and decision support systems.
