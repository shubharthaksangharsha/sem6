best first search is a searching algorithm used to find shortest path 
which used the distance as a heuristic  

the distance between the starting node and the goal node is taken as the heuristic values 


BFS algo 
create two empty list open and closed 
start from the (N) and put it into a open list  
if open is empty then return failure  
else generate all the successor of a node and put the newly generated node into a open list according to their 
heuristic values. 

reorder the nodes in the open list in ascending order according to their evaluation function
