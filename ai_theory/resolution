Resolution is a complete and sound inference rule for first-order logic. It is based on the idea of refutation: to prove that a sentence is true, we show that its negation leads to a contradiction. The resolution rule allows us to infer new clauses from a set of clauses by resolving two clauses that share complementary literals. In other words, we use resolution to eliminate redundant information from a set of clauses.

The steps involved in resolution are:

Convert the sentences in the knowledge base to clausal form.
Negate the sentence to be proved and add it to the knowledge base as a clause.
Apply resolution repeatedly until either a contradiction is found or no further inferences can be made.
Let's look at an example to illustrate how resolution works:

Suppose we have the following set of clauses in the knowledge base:

P(x) ∨ Q(x)
¬Q(x) ∨ R(x)
¬R(x)
We want to prove the sentence ¬P(x). To do so, we negate the sentence and add it to the knowledge base as a clause:

P(x)
Now, we can apply resolution to clauses 1 and 4, which share the literal P(x):

Q(x)
Then, we can apply resolution to clauses 2 and 5, which share the literal ¬Q(x):

R(x)
Finally, we can apply resolution to clauses 3 and 6, which share the literal ¬R(x):

⊥ (contradiction)
Since we have derived a contradiction, we can conclude that our original assumption, ¬P(x), must be true.

Note that resolution is a sound and complete inference rule for first-order logic. This means that if a sentence can be inferred from a set of axioms using resolution, then it is true in all possible models of the axioms. Similarly, if a sentence is true in all possible models of the axioms, then it can be inferred from the axioms using resolution.
